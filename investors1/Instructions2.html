<p>
    Your bonus consists of the amount you kept from the $1 endowment (and did not invest) and the returns to the money
    you invested.
</p>
<p>
    By investing, you can <b>triple your bonus to up to $3</b>. The returns to your investment depend on the accuracy of
    this worker’s guess.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    <b>Your bonus</b> in a round will be defined as:
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        Bonus = (Remaining) Endowment + Investment (in $) * 3 * (100 – relative deviation of the guess from the true
        value (in %))
    </b>
</p>

<br>

<p>
    To determine your bonus, we will <b>randomly choose one of your decisions</b>.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if you invested all your endowment  ($1) in this round, you will receive the following bonus:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If the accuracy of the worker’s guess <b>deviates by 0%</b> from the true value your <b>bonus will be 3$</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the accuracy of the worker’s guess <b>deviates by 50%</b> from the true value your <b>bonus will be 1.5$</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the accuracy of the worker’s guess <b>deviates by 75%</b> from the true value your <b>bonus will be 0.75$</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the accuracy of the worker’s guess <b>deviates by 100%</b> from the true value your <b>bonus will be 0$</b>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You cannot receive a negative bonus. If the guess deviates by more than 100% of the actual value, the return to your
    investment will be 0.
