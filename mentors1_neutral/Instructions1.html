            <u>Your advisee's task:</u>

        <p>
            Your advisee’s task is to <b>guess the number of blue dots</b> depicted in pictures, similar to the ones
            below (see figure 1). All pictures contain between 500 and 2000 blue dots. Your advisee sees one picture at a time. For each picture, your advisee will have 1 minute time to guess.

        <p>
            After indicating the guess about the number of blue dots in the picture, your advisee answers the question
            in figure 2.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center">

            <u>Your advisee's payment:</u>

        <p>
            Your advisee’s payment depends on the amount that an investor decides to invest in your advisee.
        </p>

    <br>
    <br>

        <p><b><u>The investor</u></b></p>

            <u>The investor's task:</u>

        <p>
            It is the investor's task to <b>decide how much to invest in your advisee</b>. When deciding how much to
            invest, the investor <b>sees only your advisee's answer to the question in figure 2</b>. The investor will
            not know your advisees guess or the actual number of blue dots in the picture.
        </p>

            <u>The investor's payment:</u>

        <p>
            The investor has an endowment of 100 Pence and has to decide how much out of the 100 Pence to invest in your
            advisee.
        </p>
        <p>
     <p>
        The investor's bonus payment depends on the <b>kept endowment, the investment and the relative deviation of your guess
            from the actual number of dots.</b>
    </p>
        <li>
            If the relative deviation of your advisee's guess is <b>10% or less</b>, the <b>bonus payment</b> amounts to <b>3 Pence * investment + kept endowment.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            If the relative deviation of your advisee's guess is <b>more than 10%, but less than 20%</b>, the <b>bonus payment</b> amounts to <b>2,7 Pence * investment + kept endowment.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            If the relative deviation of your advisee's guess is <b>more than 20%, but less than 30%</b>, the <b>bonus payment</b> amounts to <b>1,7 Pence * investment + kept endowment.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            If the relative deviation of your advisee's guess is <b>30% or more</b>, the <b>bonus payment</b> amounts to <b>0 Pence * investment + kept endowment.</b>
        </li>
