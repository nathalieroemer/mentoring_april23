        You are asked to provide advice on how to answer the question about performance in this task (see figure 1).
    </p>
    <p>
        Your advisee is ranked within a randomly matched group of four workers, who all performed the same task.
        Depending on whether your advisee performed best, second best, third best or least best within this group,
        {{ if player.treat == 't3' }}
            and depending on their original answer to the question in figure 1,
        {{ endif }}
        we ask you to provide advice to your advisee on how to answer the following question:
