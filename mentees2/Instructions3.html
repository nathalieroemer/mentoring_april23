<p>
    Your bonus equals the fraction of the investment you receive by the investor * 2 GBP.
</p>

<p>
    For example,
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If the third party invests 0% of their money in your guess, your bonus is 0.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the third party invests 50% of their money in your guess, your bonus is 1 GBP.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the third party invests 100% of their money in your guess, your bonus is 2 GBP.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We will randomly select one of the following two rounds to determine your bonus.
</p>
<p>
    The investor receives higher returns to their investment, the less your guess deviates from the correct number of
    dots in the picture.
