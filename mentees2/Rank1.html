<ul>
   <li> You will receive a bonus payment of 1 if the rank you indicate equals your true rank within this group of 4. </li>
   <li>  You will receive a bonus payment of 0.80 if the rank you indicate deviates by 1 rank from your true rank within this group of 4.  </li>
  <li>   You will receive a bonus payment of 0.20 if the rank you indicate deviates by 2 ranks from your true rank within this group of 4.  </li>
   <li>  You will receive a bonus payment of 0 if the rank you indicate deviates by 3 or more ranks from your true rank within this group of 4.  </li>
