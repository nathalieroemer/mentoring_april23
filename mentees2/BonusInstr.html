<p>
    Your bonus depends on the decision of a third party who has to choose how much to invest in your guess. Your bonus
    equals the fraction of their money that the third party invests in you * 2 GBP.
</p>

<p>
    For example,
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If the third party invests 0% of their money in your guess, your bonus is 0.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the third party invests 50% of their money in your guess, your bonus is 1 GBP.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the third party invests 100% of their money in your guess, your bonus is 2 GBP.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The third party receives higher returns to their investment, the more accurate your guess is.
