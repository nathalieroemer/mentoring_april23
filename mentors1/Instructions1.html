        In the following, you will be matched with a worker. It will be your task to give advice to this worker. We will

            <u>Your advisee's task:</u>

        <p>
            Your advisee’s task is to <b>guess the number of blue dots</b> depicted in pictures, similar to the ones
            below (see figure 1). All pictures contain between 500 and 2000 blue dots. Your advisee sees one picture at a time. For each picture, your advisee will have 1 minute time to guess.
    </p>

                        Correct answer: 500 dots

        </p>
        <p>
            After indicating the guess about the number of blue dots in the picture, your advisee answers a question related to the
            precision of the guess (100% - % deviation to the actual number of blue dots in the picture). See figure 2.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center">
            <i>Please indicate how well you think you did in guessing the number of blue dots in the picture:</i>

            <u>Your advisee's payment:</u>

        <p>
            Your advisee’s payment depends on the amount that an investor decides to invest in your advisee.
        </p>

    <br>
    <br>

        <p><b><u>The investor</u></b></p>

            <u>The investor's task:</u>

        <p>
            It is the investor's task to <b>decide how much to invest in your advisee</b>. When deciding how much to
            invest, the investor <b>sees only your advisee's answer to the question in figure 2</b>. The investor will
            not know your advisee's guess or the actual number of blue dots in the picture.
        </p>

            <u>The investor's payment:</u>

       <p>
            The investor has an endowment of 100 Pence and has to decide how much out of the 100 Pence to invest in your advisee.
            The investor's bonus payment depends on the investor's investment in your advisee and the precision of your advisee's guess.
        </p>

    <p>
        We designed the investor's bonus payment such that <b>the investor should invest more, the higher the investor thinks the precision of your advisee's guess is.</b>
        Figure 3 displays the investment maximizing the investor's bonus payment, depending on the precision of your advisee's guess.
