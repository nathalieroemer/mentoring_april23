        In the following, <b>you will be working as a mentor for workers from another task</b>. These workers' task is
        to guess the number of dots in a picture, similar to the one below (see figure 1). In the following you will be
        matched with workers from this task - that we will call in the following "your mentees" - and provide them with
        advice.
    </p>

        <i style="font-size: smaller">Figure 1</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Your mentees' earnings</b> depend on <b>how much a third party investor invests in their guess</b> about the
        number of dots in the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
        After having completed their task, <b>your mentees</b> are aksed to <b>answer the following question</b> (see
        figure 2):
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        <i>Please indicate how well you think you did in guessing the accurate number of blue dots in the picture.</i>

        <br>
        <i style="font-size: smaller">Figure 2</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        Your mentees' answer to the question in figure 2 will be shown to the third party investors when making their
        investment decisions. The investors earn more money, the better the guess of the worker they invested in is.
