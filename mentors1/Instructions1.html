        In the following, you will be working as a mentor. You are matched with other workers, who had to guess the number
        of dots in a picture, similar to the one below (see figure 1).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="{{ static 'graphic1.png' }}"/>
        <br>
        <i style="font-size: smaller">Figure 1</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        These workers' earnings depend on how much a third party investor invests in their guess.
    </p>
    <p>
        After having completed the task, these workers have to answer the following self-evaluation question:
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        <i>Please indicate how well you think you did in guessing the accurate number of blue dots in the picture.</i>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="{{ static 'exampleGuess.png' }}"/>
        <br>
        <i style="font-size: smaller">Figure 2</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        The workerâ€™s answer to this question <i>"Please indicate how well you think you did in guessing the accurate number
        of blue dots in the picture"</i> will be shown to the third party investors when making their investment decisions.
        The investors earn more money, the better the guess of the worker they invested in is.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a mentor, it is your task now to advice the workers you have been matched to - your mentees - on how to answer
        the question <i>"Please indicate how well you think you did in guessing the accurate number of blue dots in the
        picture"</i> best.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, we will ask you for your advice, depending on how well your mentee did in comparison to 3 randomly drawn
        other workers that had to guess the number of dots in computer-generated pictures in a prior task. That is, we will
        ask you to provide us with your advice, given that your mentee's guess was either the best, among this group of 4,
        the second best, the third best, or the fourth best.
    </p>
    <p>
        After matching you with your mentee and evaluating the mentee's performance, we will provide your mentee with the
        corresponding advice.
    </p>
