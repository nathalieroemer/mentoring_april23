        It is your task now to advise your mentees on how to answer the question in figure 1 below, <b>depending on how
        well your mentee actually did in comparison to 3 other workers from a prior task</b>. Those other workers also had
        to guess the number of dots in computer-generated pictures and are selected by chance.
