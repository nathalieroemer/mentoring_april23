<p> In the following, we ask you <b>to predict the accuracy of a worker's guess</b>, depending on the answer to the following question:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
        <i>Please indicate how well you think you did in guessing the number of blue dots in the picture:</i>
        <img src="{{ static 'exampleGuess.png' }}" class="resp"/>
        <br>
        <i style="font-size: smaller">Figure 1: The worker's question</i>
</p>

<p> Remember, that the <b>accuracy of the guess</b> is computed as 100% - % relative deviation from the actual number of dots (% relative deviation =<math> <mfrac>

                       <mi> |actual no. dots - guess|</mi>


                        <mi> actual no. dots</mi>

</mfrac> * 100</math>), and <b>0</b>, if the <b>guess deviates</b> from the actual number of dots <b>by more than the actual number</b>.
        <p>

<p>We will randomly match you to a worker. Note that you will not be matched to the same worker that you
    have been previously matched to.</p>


<p> Depending on your prediction, you can earn an extra bonus payment of up to <b>£1.00</b>. Your extra bonus payment will be higher,
    <b> the closer your prediction is to the true accuracy of this worker's guess.</b>

<p><u>Your bonus payment </u>  </p>
<p>
<ul>
   <li> Your additional bonus payment is <b>£1.00</b> if your prediction deviates by less than 10 percentage points (pp.) from the actual accuracy of the worker's guess. </li>
   <li>  Your additional bonus payment is <b>£0.75</b> if your prediction deviates by 10 or more, but less than 20 pp. from the actual accuracy of the worker's guess.  </li>
  <li>   Your additional bonus payment is <b>£0.25</b> if your prediction deviates by more than 20 or more, but less than 30 pp. the actual accuracy of the worker's guess.  </li>
   <li>  Your additional bonus payment is <b>£0.00</b> if your prediction deviates by 30 pp. or more from the actual accuracy of the worker's guess.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Please provide your prediction for all six possible answers provided by the worker in the table below. </p>
